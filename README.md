A fully functional and explicitely followed implementation from <i>Shi et. al</i>'s work on "Convolutional LSTM Network: A Machine Learning Approach for Precipitation Nowcasting." 
While this **nn.Module** is fully functional, it's parameter count is quite high from repeated convolutional matrices, that could be simplified. This original approach shown in **conv-lstm-shi-et-al.py** is meant to be an explicitely followed implementation of that work. 
More efficient versions to follow.
